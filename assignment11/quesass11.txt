1. Create a 'Rectangle' class with two data members, length and breadth, and a function to calculate the area that is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors, which are as follows:
a - no parameter - length and breadth values are both set to zero.
b - using two numbers as parameters, one for length and one for breadth.
c - Using a single number as a parameter - that number is assigned to both length and breadth.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one, and two parameters and print their areas.

2. Write a program to calculate the salary of Indian Railway employees. Three
are three types of employees in Indian railways. They are regular, daily wages
and consolidated employees. Gross Pay for the employees is calculated as
follows:
a - regular employees = basic + HRA + ((10% of DA) * basic)
b - Daily wages = wages per hour * number of hours
c - Consolidated = a fixed amount
